## How to use?

Download all files, and open the .Rproj file.

Open either the `server.R` or the `ui.R` and click `Run App` in the upper right hand corner of the script.

To get random images, click the `Click to Shuffle` button in the upper right hand corner.

## Editing

The colors can be changed in the `global.R` file which provides RGB values for the different panels. 

The text can also be changed, but have to be careful as some text are actually variables that link the UI script to the server script and may break the application.
